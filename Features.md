# Company stats feature

## Idea

- create a collection of stocks
- idea is that they complement each other
- and as a group they move at some 10% or something
- and we invest as a SIP into them each month
- lets says there are 10 stocks
- then at the end of 10 months whichever has fallen most in 10 months and not used in last 10 months
- buy that with SIP amount - Idea is simplest form of this
- Rules can vary for each item


## Steps to implement

- allow multiple lists of such
- user creates a new list and add stocks to it
- lets say they add 10 stocks to this list
- show details of each stock like lowest value in last 52 weeks
- or highest/lowest value in n*10 months
- variation in last month / last 2 months
- other details as well
- also last bought date that user can add as well if buys this in this month
- 

## Need
