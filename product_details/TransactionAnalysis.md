**Transaction analysis** is the process of examining and interpreting financial transactions to understand their impact on a companyâ€™s financial statements. It involves identifying the accounts affected by a transaction, determining whether they increase or decrease, and ensuring the accounting equation (Assets = Liabilities + Equity) remains balanced. Hereâ€™s a detailed guide on how to perform transaction analysis, along with examples:

---

### **1. Steps in Transaction Analysis**

#### **Step 1: Identify the Transaction**
   - Determine the nature of the transaction (e.g., sale, purchase, payment, receipt).
   - Identify the parties involved (e.g., customer, supplier, employee).

#### **Step 2: Determine the Accounts Affected**
   - Identify which accounts in the financial statements are impacted (e.g., Cash, Accounts Receivable, Inventory, Revenue).

#### **Step 3: Classify the Accounts**
   - Classify the accounts as **Assets**, **Liabilities**, **Equity**, **Revenue**, or **Expenses**.

#### **Step 4: Determine the Direction of Change**
   - Decide whether each account increases or decreases as a result of the transaction.

#### **Step 5: Apply the Accounting Equation**
   - Ensure that the transaction keeps the accounting equation balanced:
     \[
     \text{Assets} = \text{Liabilities} + \text{Equity}
     \]

#### **Step 6: Record the Transaction**
   - Use journal entries to record the transaction in the general ledger.

### **2. Examples of Transaction Analysis**

#### **Example 1: Sale of Goods on Credit**
   - **Transaction:** A company sells goods worth $1,000 on credit to a customer.
   - **Accounts Affected:**
     - **Accounts Receivable (Asset):** Increases by $1,000.
     - **Sales Revenue (Revenue):** Increases by $1,000.
   - **Journal Entry:**
     \[
     \text{Accounts Receivable} \quad 1,000 \quad \text{Debit}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Sales Revenue} \quad 1,000 \quad \text{Credit}
     \]
   - **Impact on Accounting Equation:**
     - Assets increase by $1,000 (Accounts Receivable).
     - Equity increases by $1,000 (Sales Revenue).
     - The equation remains balanced.

#### **Example 2: Purchase of Inventory on Credit**
   - **Transaction:** A company purchases inventory worth $500 on credit from a supplier.
   - **Accounts Affected:**
     - **Inventory (Asset):** Increases by $500.
     - **Accounts Payable (Liability):** Increases by $500.
   - **Journal Entry:**
     \[
     \text{Inventory} \quad 500 \quad \text{Debit}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Accounts Payable} \quad 500 \quad \text{Credit}
     \]
   - **Impact on Accounting Equation:**
     - Assets increase by $500 (Inventory).
     - Liabilities increase by $500 (Accounts Payable).
     - The equation remains balanced.

#### **Example 3: Payment of Salaries**
   - **Transaction:** A company pays $2,000 in salaries to employees.
   - **Accounts Affected:**
     - **Cash (Asset):** Decreases by $2,000.
     - **Salaries Expense (Expense):** Increases by $2,000.
   - **Journal Entry:**
     \[
     \text{Salaries Expense} \quad 2,000 \quad \text{Debit}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Cash} \quad 2,000 \quad \text{Credit}
     \]
   - **Impact on Accounting Equation:**
     - Assets decrease by $2,000 (Cash).
     - Equity decreases by $2,000 (Salaries Expense reduces Net Income, which is part of Equity).
     - The equation remains balanced.

#### **Example 4: Receipt of Cash from Customers**
   - **Transaction:** A company receives $1,500 in cash from customers for goods sold on credit.
   - **Accounts Affected:**
     - **Cash (Asset):** Increases by $1,500.
     - **Accounts Receivable (Asset):** Decreases by $1,500.
   - **Journal Entry:**

     \]
     \[
     \text{Accounts Receivable} \quad 1,500 \quad \text{Credit}
     \]
   - **Impact on Accounting Equation:**
     - One asset (Cash) increases by $1,500.
     - Another asset (Accounts Receivable) decreases by $1,500.
     - The equation remains balanced.

     \]
   - **Impact on Accounting Equation:**
     - Assets increase by $10,000 (Cash).
     - Equity increases by $10,000 (Common Stock).
