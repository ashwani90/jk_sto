**Organic growth** refers to a companyâ€™s ability to increase revenue, profits, and market share through internal efforts, such as improving operations, launching new products, or expanding into new markets, **without relying on mergers, acquisitions, or external investments**. It is a key indicator of a companyâ€™s operational efficiency, innovation, and long-term sustainability. Letâ€™s break it down in detail, including how to identify and measure organic growth, along with examples.

### **1. What is Organic Growth?**
Organic growth is achieved through:

### **2. How to Measure Organic Growth**
To evaluate organic growth, analyze the following metrics:

#### **a. Revenue Growth**
   - Compare year-over-year (YoY) or quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) revenue growth.
   - Exclude revenue from acquisitions to isolate organic growth.
   - **Formula:**  
     \[
     \text{Organic Revenue Growth} = \frac{\text{Current Period Revenue} - \text{Revenue from Acquisitions}}{\text{Previous Period Revenue}} \times 100
     \]

#### **b. Same-Store Sales (for Retail)**
   - Measures growth in sales from existing stores (excluding new store openings).
   - **Example:** Walmart (WMT) reports same-store sales to show growth in its existing locations.

#### **c. Customer Growth**
   - Track the increase in the number of customers or users.
   - **Example:** Netflix (NFLX) reports subscriber growth as a key metric.

#### **d. Market Share**
   - Analyze the companyâ€™s share of the total market.
   - **Example:** Apple (AAPL) gaining market share in the smartphone industry.

#### **e. Profit Margins**
   - Improving margins through cost efficiency or higher sales volumes indicates organic growth.
   - **Example:** Amazon (AMZN) improving margins in its AWS (cloud computing) division.
