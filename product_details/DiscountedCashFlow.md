# **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) in Valuation Analysis of a Company**

## **Introduction**
Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) is a fundamental valuation method used to estimate the **intrinsic value** of a business or investment based on its projected future cash flows. The idea behind DCF is that a business is worth the present value of all future cash flows it will generate, discounted back to today.

DCF is widely used in **investment banking, corporate finance, private equity, and stock analysis** to determine whether an asset is undervalued or overvalued.

## **Key Concepts in DCF Valuation**
1. **Free Cash Flow (FCF)** ‚Äì The cash a company generates after accounting for expenses and reinvestment.
2. **Discount Rate (WACC)** ‚Äì The rate at which future cash flows are discounted to present value.
3. **Terminal Value (TV)** ‚Äì The estimated value of the business beyond the projection period.
4. **Enterprise Value (EV) and Equity Value** ‚Äì Determines the total value of the firm and per-share valuation.

## **Step-by-Step Guide to DCF Valuation**

### **Step 1: Forecast the Free Cash Flows (FCF)**
Free Cash Flow represents the cash available to investors after necessary expenses. It is commonly calculated as:

\[
FCFF = EBIT \times (1 - \text{Tax Rate}) + \text{Depreciation} - \text{Capital Expenditures} - \text{Change in Working Capital}
\]

Where:
- **EBIT** = Earnings Before Interest and Taxes
- **Depreciation** = Non-cash expense
- **Capital Expenditures (CapEx)** = Investments in fixed assets
- **Change in Working Capital** = Difference in current assets and liabilities

üí° Typically, FCF is projected for **5‚Äì10 years**.

### **Example: Free Cash Flow Forecast**
| Year | Projected Free Cash Flow (FCF in million $) |
|------|----------------------------------|
| 1    | 10                               |
| 2    | 12                               |
| 3    | 14                               |
| 4    | 16                               |
| 5    | 18                               |

---

### **Step 2: Determine the Discount Rate (WACC)**
The discount rate represents the return required by investors. It is commonly calculated using **Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC):**

\[
WACC = \left( \frac{E}{E+D} \times Re \right) + \left( \frac{D}{E+D} \times Rd \times (1 - \text{Tax Rate}) \right)
\]

Where:
- **E** = Market value of equity
- **D** = Market value of debt
- **Re** = Cost of equity (calculated using CAPM)
- **Rd** = Cost of debt
- **Tax Rate** = Corporate tax rate

Assume **WACC = 10%**.

---

### **Step 3: Discount Future Cash Flows**
Each projected FCF is discounted to present value using:

\[
PV = \frac{FCF_t}{(1 + r)^t}
\]

Where:
- **FCF_t** = Free Cash Flow in year **t**
- **r** = Discount rate (WACC)
- **t** = Year number

| Year | FCF ($M) | Discount Factor (10%) | Present Value ($M) |
|------|----------|----------------------|------------------|
| 1    | 10       | 1.00 / 1.10^1 = 0.91 | 9.09            |
| 2    | 12       | 1.00 / 1.10^2 = 0.83 | 9.92            |
| 3    | 14       | 1.00 / 1.10^3 = 0.75 | 10.53           |
| 4    | 16       | 1.00 / 1.10^4 = 0.68 | 10.94           |
| 5    | 18       | 1.00 / 1.10^5 = 0.62 | 11.17           |

üí∞ **Total Present Value of FCFs =** **$51.65 million**

---

### **Step 4: Calculate Terminal Value (TV)**
Since a company operates indefinitely, we estimate its value beyond the forecast period using the **Gordon Growth Model:**

\[
TV = \frac{FCF_n \times (1 + g)}{r - g}
\]

Where:
- **FCF_n** = Free Cash Flow in the last forecast year ($18M)
- **g** = Long-term growth rate (assume 3%)
- **r** = WACC (10%)

\[
TV = \frac{18 \times (1.03)}{0.10 - 0.03} = \frac{18.54}{0.07} = 265M
\]

üîπ **Present Value of Terminal Value:**
\[
PV_{TV} = \frac{265}{(1.10)^5} = 164.3M
\]

---

### **Step 5: Calculate Enterprise Value (EV)**
\[
EV = \sum PV_{FCF} + PV_{TV}
\]

\[
EV = 51.65 + 164.3 = 215.95M
\]

---

### **Step 6: Derive Equity Value and Share Price**
To calculate **Equity Value**, subtract **Net Debt** from **Enterprise Value**:

\[
\text{Equity Value} = EV - \text{Net Debt}
\]

Assume **Net Debt = $50M**:

\[
\text{Equity Value} = 215.95 - 50 = 165.95M
\]

To find the **Intrinsic Share Price**:

\[
\text{Intrinsic Share Price} = \frac{\text{Equity Value}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}
\]

Assume **Shares Outstanding = 10M**:

\[
\text{Intrinsic Share Price} = \frac{165.95}{10} = 16.60
\]

‚úÖ **Final Valuation: The company‚Äôs estimated share price is $16.60 per share.**

## **Advantages of DCF Valuation**
‚úÖ **Intrinsic Valuation** ‚Äì Not dependent on market conditions.  
‚úÖ **Flexible** ‚Äì Can model different growth scenarios.  
‚úÖ **Long-Term Perspective** ‚Äì Accounts for future earnings potential.  

---

## **Limitations of DCF Valuation**
‚ùå **Highly Sensitive to Assumptions** ‚Äì Small changes in WACC or growth rate can cause large swings in value.  
‚ùå **Difficult for Startups** ‚Äì Requires stable cash flows.  
‚ùå **Long-Term Forecasting is Challenging** ‚Äì Future performance is uncertain.  

---

## **Conclusion**
DCF is a **powerful** tool for estimating a company‚Äôs fair value based on its future cash flows. However, it should be complemented with **market-based valuation methods** like **P/E ratio, EV/EBITDA**, and **comparable company analysis (CCA)** to get a holistic view.

**Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)** is a valuation method used to estimate the intrinsic value of a company by forecasting its future cash flows and discounting them back to their present value. It is one of the most widely used and theoretically sound methods for valuing a company. Here‚Äôs a detailed explanation of DCF, including the steps involved, formulas, and examples.

---

### **1. What is Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)?**
DCF is based on the principle that the value of a company is equal to the present value of all the cash flows it will generate in the future. It accounts for the **time value of money**, meaning that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future due to its earning potential.

---

### **2. Steps to Perform a DCF Analysis**

#### **Step 1: Forecast Free Cash Flows (FCF)**
   - **Free Cash Flow (FCF):** The cash generated by the company after accounting for operating expenses and capital expenditures.
   - **Formula:**  
     \[
     \text{FCF} = \text{Net Income} + \text{Depreciation/Amortization} - \text{Changes in Working Capital} - \text{Capital Expenditures (CapEx)}
     \]
   - **Forecasting Period:** Typically 5‚Äì10 years, depending on the company‚Äôs growth stage and industry.

   **Example:** If a company has:
   - Net Income: $100 million
   - Depreciation: $20 million
   - Changes in Working Capital: -$10 million
   - CapEx: $30 million  
   Then, FCF = $100M + $20M - (-$10M) - $30M = **$100 million**.

---

#### **Step 2: Estimate Terminal Value (TV)**
   - **Terminal Value:** Represents the value of the company beyond the forecast period, assuming stable growth.
   - **Two Common Methods:**
     1. **Perpetuity Growth Model:**  
        \[
        \text{TV} = \frac{\text{FCF in Final Year} \times (1 + g)}{r - g}
        \]
        Where:
        - \( g \): Long-term growth rate (usually 2‚Äì4%, close to GDP growth).
        - \( r \): Discount rate (Weighted Average Cost of Capital - WACC).
     2. **Exit Multiple Method:**  
        \[
        \text{TV} = \text{FCF in Final Year} \times \text{Exit Multiple}
        \]
        (Exit multiples are based on industry benchmarks, e.g., EV/EBITDA).

   **Example:** If FCF in the final year is $150 million, \( g = 3\% \), and \( r = 10\% \):  
   \[
   \text{TV} = \frac{150 \times (1 + 0.03)}{0.10 - 0.03} = \frac{154.5}{0.07} = **$2.21 billion**.
   \]

---

#### **Step 3: Calculate the Discount Rate (WACC)**
   - **Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC):** The average rate of return required by all of the company‚Äôs investors (debt and equity holders).
   - **Formula:**  
     \[
     \text{WACC} = \left( \frac{E}{E + D} \times r_e \right) + \left( \frac{D}{E + D} \times r_d \times (1 - \text{Tax Rate}) \right)
     \]
     Where:
     - \( E \): Market value of equity.
     - \( D \): Market value of debt.
     - \( r_e \): Cost of equity (calculated using CAPM).
     - \( r_d \): Cost of debt (interest rate on debt).

   **Example:** If:
   - Equity (\( E \)) = $500 million
   - Debt (\( D \)) = $200 million
   - Cost of equity (\( r_e \)) = 12%
   - Cost of debt (\( r_d \)) = 5%
   - Tax rate = 20%  
   Then:
   \[
   \text{WACC} = \left( \frac{500}{700} \times 0.12 \right) + \left( \frac{200}{700} \times 0.05 \times (1 - 0.20) \right) = 0.0857 + 0.0114 = **9.71\%**.
   \]

---

#### **Step 4: Discount Cash Flows to Present Value**
   - Discount the forecasted FCFs and terminal value to their present value using the WACC.
   - **Formula:**  
     \[
     \text{Present Value (PV)} = \frac{\text{Future Cash Flow}}{(1 + r)^t}
     \]
     Where:
     - \( r \): Discount rate (WACC).
     - \( t \): Number of years in the future.

   **Example:** If FCF in Year 1 is $100 million and WACC is 10%:  
   \[
   \text{PV} = \frac{100}{(1 + 0.10)^1} = **$90.91 million**.
   \]

---

#### **Step 5: Sum the Present Values**
   - Add the present values of all forecasted FCFs and the terminal value to get the **Enterprise Value (EV)**.
   - **Formula:**  
     \[
     \text{EV} = \sum_{t=1}^n \frac{\text{FCF}_t}{(1 + r)^t} + \frac{\text{TV}}{(1 + r)^n}
     \]

   **Example:** If the sum of PVs of FCFs is $800 million and the PV of the terminal value is $1.5 billion:  
   \[
   \text{EV} = 800 + 1,500 = **$2.3 billion**.
   \]

---

#### **Step 6: Calculate Equity Value and Share Price**
   - Subtract net debt (debt minus cash) from EV to get **Equity Value**.
   - Divide Equity Value by the number of shares outstanding to get the **Intrinsic Share Price**.
   - **Formula:**  
     \[
     \text{Equity Value} = \text{EV} - \text{Net Debt}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Intrinsic Share Price} = \frac{\text{Equity Value}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}
     \]

   **Example:** If EV = $2.3 billion, net debt = $300 million, and shares outstanding = 100 million:  
   \[
   \text{Equity Value} = 2,300 - 300 = **$2 billion**.
   \]
   \[
   \text{Intrinsic Share Price} = \frac{2,000}{100} = **$20 per share**.
   \]

### **3. Example of DCF Valuation**

Let‚Äôs value a hypothetical company, **XYZ Corp**:
- **Forecasted FCFs (in millions):**  
  Year 1: $100  
  Year 2: $120  
  Year 3: $140  
  Year 4: $160  
  Year 5: $180  
- **Terminal Growth Rate (\( g \)):** 3%  
- **WACC (\( r \)):** 10%  
- **Net Debt:** $200 million  
- **Shares Outstanding:** 50 million  

#### **Step 1: Discount FCFs**
   \[
   \text{PV of FCFs} = \frac{100}{(1.10)^1} + \frac{120}{(1.10)^2} + \frac{140}{(1.10)^3} + \frac{160}{(1.10)^4} + \frac{180}{(1.10)^5} = 90.91 + 99.17 + 105.18 + 109.28 + 111.68 = **$516.22 million**.
   \]

#### **Step 2: Calculate Terminal Value**
   \[
   \text{TV} = \frac{180 \times (1 + 0.03)}{0.10 - 0.03} = \frac{185.4}{0.07} = **$2,648.57 million**.
   \]
   \[
   \text{PV of TV} = \frac{2,648.57}{(1.10)^5} = **$1,644.93 million**.
   \]

#### **Step 3: Calculate Enterprise Value**
   \[
   \text{EV} = 516.22 + 1,644.93 = **$2,161.15 million**.
   \]

#### **Step 4: Calculate Equity Value and Share Price**
   \[
   \text{Equity Value} = 2,161.15 - 200 = **$1,961.15 million**.
   \]
   \[
   \text{Intrinsic Share Price} = \frac{1,961.15}{50} = **$39.22 per share**.
   \]
