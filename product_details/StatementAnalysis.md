### **2. Analyze Financial Statements**

Financial statements provide a snapshot of a companyâ€™s financial health and performance. There are three main statements to analyze:

---

#### **a. Income Statement**
The income statement shows a companyâ€™s revenues, expenses, and profits over a specific period (quarterly or annually). Key components include:

1. **Revenue (Top Line):**
   - Total income generated from sales of goods or services.
   - **Example:** Apple (AAPL) reported $394.3 billion in revenue for FY 2022, primarily from iPhone sales.

2. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):**
   - Direct costs of producing goods or services.
   - **Example:** For Tesla (TSLA), COGS includes the cost of batteries, labor, and materials for manufacturing EVs.

3. **Gross Profit:**
   - Revenue minus COGS.
   - **Gross Margin:** Gross profit as a percentage of revenue.
     - **Example:** A high gross margin (e.g., Microsoft (MSFT) at 68%) indicates strong pricing power or cost efficiency.

4. **Operating Expenses:**
   - Costs not directly tied to production, such as R&D, marketing, and administrative expenses.
   - **Example:** Amazon (AMZN) spends heavily on R&D and marketing to maintain its competitive edge.

5. **Operating Income (EBIT):**
   - Gross profit minus operating expenses.
   - **Example:** Google (Alphabet - GOOGL) reported $78.7 billion in operating income for 2022, driven by ad revenue.

6. **Net Income (Bottom Line):**
   - Total profit after all expenses, taxes, and interest.
   - **Example:** Netflix (NFLX) reported $4.5 billion in net income for 2022, reflecting its profitability after content investments.

#### **b. Balance Sheet**
The balance sheet provides a snapshot of a companyâ€™s assets, liabilities, and shareholdersâ€™ equity at a specific point in time. Key components include:

1. **Assets:**
   - **Current Assets:** Cash, inventory, and receivables expected to be converted to cash within a year.
     - **Example:** Walmart (WMT) holds significant inventory to meet customer demand.
   - **Non-Current Assets:** Long-term investments, property, and equipment.
     - **Example:** Tesla (TSLA) owns Gigafactories valued at billions of dollars.

2. **Liabilities:**
   - **Current Liabilities:** Short-term debts and payables due within a year.
     - **Example:** Apple (AAPL) has accounts payable to suppliers for components.
   - **Non-Current Liabilities:** Long-term debt and obligations.
     - **Example:** AT&T (T) carries significant long-term debt from acquisitions.

3. **Shareholdersâ€™ Equity:**
   - The residual interest in assets after deducting liabilities.
   - **Example:** Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) has a strong equity base due to retained earnings and investments.

4. **Key Metrics:**
   - **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** Measures financial leverage.
     - **Example:** A high ratio (e.g., Boeing (BA) at 1.5) indicates higher risk.
   - **Current Ratio:** Measures liquidity (current assets Ã· current liabilities).
     - **Example:** A ratio above 1 (e.g., Coca-Cola (KO) at 1.2) suggests good short-term financial health.

---

#### **c. Cash Flow Statement**
The cash flow statement tracks the flow of cash in and out of a company, divided into three sections:

1. **Operating Activities:**
   - Cash generated from core business operations.
   - **Example:** Microsoft (MSFT) consistently generates strong operating cash flow from software sales and cloud services.

2. **Investing Activities:**
   - Cash used for investments in assets or acquisitions.
   - **Example:** Amazon (AMZN) invests heavily in infrastructure (e.g., warehouses, AWS data centers).

3. **Financing Activities:**
   - Cash from issuing debt or equity, or paying dividends.
   - **Example:** Apple (AAPL) returns cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.

4. **Free Cash Flow (FCF):**
   - Cash from operations minus capital expenditures.
   - **Example:** Google (Alphabet - GOOGL) uses FCF to fund acquisitions (e.g., Fitbit) and R&D.

   - **Income Statement:** High revenue ($394.3 billion in 2022) and net income ($99.8 billion) driven by iPhone sales and services.
   - **Balance Sheet:** Strong cash position ($48 billion) and low debt-to-equity ratio (1.7).
   - **Cash Flow Statement:** Generates significant operating cash flow ($122 billion) and FCF ($111 billion).

2. **Tesla (TSLA):**
   - **Income Statement:** Revenue growth ($81.5 billion in 2022) but lower margins due to high R&D and production costs.
   - **Balance Sheet:** High capital expenditures for Gigafactories and inventory.
   - **Cash Flow Statement:** Positive FCF ($7.6 billion) but heavy investing activities.

3. **Amazon (AMZN):**
   - **Income Statement:** High revenue ($513.9 billion in 2022) but lower net income due to heavy investments.
   - **Balance Sheet:** Significant liabilities from accounts payable and long-term debt.
   - **Cash Flow Statement:** Strong operating cash flow ($46.8 billion) but negative FCF due to capex.
