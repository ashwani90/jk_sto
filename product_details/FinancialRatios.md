### **3. Evaluate Key Financial Ratios**

Financial ratios help you compare a companyâ€™s performance with its peers and industry averages. They are divided into several categories:

---

#### **a. Valuation Ratios**
These ratios help determine whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued.

1. **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio:**
   - **Formula:** Market Price per Share Ã· Earnings per Share (EPS).
   - **Interpretation:** A high P/E may indicate overvaluation or high growth expectations.
   - **Example:** As of 2023, Apple (AAPL) has a P/E of ~28, while the S&P 500 average is ~20. This suggests investors are willing to pay a premium for Appleâ€™s growth.

2. **Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio:**
   - **Formula:** Market Price per Share Ã· Book Value per Share.
   - **Interpretation:** A P/B below 1 may indicate undervaluation.
   - **Example:** Bank of America (BAC) has a P/B of ~1.1, reflecting its stable book value.

3. **Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio:**
   - **Formula:** Market Price per Share Ã· Revenue per Share.
   - **Interpretation:** Useful for companies with low or negative earnings.
   - **Example:** Tesla (TSLA) has a P/S of ~8, indicating investors are paying a premium for its revenue growth.

#### **b. Profitability Ratios**
These ratios measure a companyâ€™s ability to generate profits.

1. **Return on Equity (ROE):**
   - **Formula:** Net Income Ã· Shareholdersâ€™ Equity.

2. **Return on Assets (ROA):**
   - **Formula:** Net Income Ã· Total Assets.
   - **Interpretation:** Measures how efficiently assets are used to generate profit.

3. **Gross Margin:**
   - **Formula:** (Revenue - COGS) Ã· Revenue.
   - **Interpretation:** Higher margins indicate better pricing power or cost control.
   - **Example:** Coca-Cola (KO) has a gross margin of ~60%, reflecting its strong brand and pricing power.

#### **c. Liquidity Ratios**
These ratios assess a companyâ€™s ability to meet short-term obligations.

1. **Current Ratio:**
   - **Formula:** Current Assets Ã· Current Liabilities.
   - **Interpretation:** A ratio above 1 indicates good short-term liquidity.
   - **Example:** Apple (AAPL) has a current ratio of ~1.1, reflecting its strong liquidity position.

2. **Quick Ratio:**
   - **Formula:** (Current Assets - Inventory) Ã· Current Liabilities.
   - **Interpretation:** A stricter measure of liquidity.
   - **Example:** Amazon (AMZN) has a quick ratio of ~0.8, indicating reliance on inventory for liquidity.

#### **d. Debt Ratios**
These ratios measure a companyâ€™s leverage and ability to manage debt.

1. **Debt-to-Equity (D/E) Ratio:**
   - **Formula:** Total Liabilities Ã· Shareholdersâ€™ Equity.
   - **Interpretation:** A high ratio may indicate higher financial risk.

---

#### **e. Efficiency Ratios**
These ratios measure how well a company utilizes its assets and manages operations.

1. **Asset Turnover Ratio:**
   - **Formula:** Revenue Ã· Total Assets.
   - **Interpretation:** Higher ratios indicate better asset utilization.
   - **Example:** Walmart (WMT) has an asset turnover ratio of ~2.5, reflecting efficient use of assets.

2. **Inventory Turnover Ratio:**
